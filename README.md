# Calendar Schedular
Hack NJIT 2016 Project

This is project is an exploration of automatic calendar scheduling. The main purpose is to schedule long term projects (20+ hours) over a long period of time. It works by linking to your Google Calendar account and looking for gaps in your schedule. It has configurable elements such as what time you want to work on the project and how long each "session" should be.
